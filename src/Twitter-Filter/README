< Creating training data > 

1. Run gen_topics with training data (original tweets JSON)

    > python gen_topics.py ..\data\training\tweets.json
    
2. Label the "topic_keys.csv" with 0 and 1 file by adding a column zero and
   save the labeled file as "topics_keys_labeled.csv"
3. Run gen_training_data with training data (original tweets JSON)

    > python gen_training_data.py ..\data\training\tweets.json

< Using training data >

1. Run gen_filtered_tweets with the source as the unfiltered tweets file and the
   destination as the output folder. This script assumes you have already
   created the training data from the previous step.
   
   > python gen_filtered_tweets.py ..\data\unfiltered\tweets.json ..\data\filtered
   
Note: The source file in this case is tweets.json but can be named anything you
want and the resulting file will then be named the same way as the source.

< Viewing the filtered data >

1. View the file that is named the same as the unfiltered source you provided
   within the destination folder that you specified
